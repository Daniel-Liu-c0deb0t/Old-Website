							This website was created as a cool, artistic side project.
							It can also act like a cool graphical portfolio for my web design skills.
							As such, only the front page exists and most links to blog 
							posts goes to my other, actual site on Wordpress.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class = "body_font">
							This site was created using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript (obviously).
							JQuery was used to make JavaScripting easier. Font Awesome was 
							also used for some icons. Images found on Pexels were used as 
							inspiration. Google's Fonts API provided an easy way to 
							incorporate cool fonts into the website.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class = "body_font">
							Two websites that provided me with lots of inspiration and got me 
							to start creating this website was <a href = "http://darli-fra.jp/">darli-fra.jp</a> 
							and <a href = "http://fate-extra-lastencore.com/">fate-extra-lastencore.com</a>.
							Also, I chose to focus on roses and the color red for no reason in the design. It
							just looks elegant.
